This poster series was created to explore how typography can communicate emotion and energy through layout. Each poster uses a limited color palette and plays with bold type, asymmetrical grids, and negative space.




- Adobe InDesign for layout
- Adobe Photoshop for texture and blending modes
- Color palette inspired by Bauhaus minimalism



This project helped develop a stronger sense of visual hierarchy and gave me the opportunity to experiment with type-as-image. The final posters were printed on 13x19" matte stock for our in-class critique.
